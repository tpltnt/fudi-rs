An implementation of the Fast Universal Digital Interface networking protocol. This can be used to communicate with Pure Data via the netsend / netreceive objects.

A message needs a trailing newline (i.e. '\n') according to the Java example in the [old wiki page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120304071510/http://wiki.puredata.info/en/FUDI). This is not explicitly mentioned in the FUDI specification.
